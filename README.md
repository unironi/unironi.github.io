# About Me

Hi! I'm Oroni, and I recently graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Computer Science + HCI Specialization + Psychology minor. I am currently looking for full-time opportunities related to web development, software development, data science, [UI/UX design](https://unironi.github.io/Design-Portfolio/), front-end, full-stack, or even computational art. I have dabbled in a little bit of many topics, so I could go in any direction at the moment (in terms of simulated annealing, my career life is represented by a very high temperature). I have also been a life-long art hobbyist including hand-drawn illustration and digital art. While I am done with school now, I have been staying on top of industry trends (e.g. Next.js, SQL, Python in more data science applications, etc.), reviewing my past courses, and cooking up some personal project ideas. 

You can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oroni-hasan/) or email me at [o3hasan@uwaterloo.ca](o3hasan@uwaterloo.ca) or [oronihasan@gmail.com](oronihasan@gmail.com).
